#About
Done for a hackdavis challenge by RE-VOLV

This integrates the form and calculates a projected score for value of projects, and displays the projects in that order.

The pages are loaded on:
localhost:3000/formpage for the form
localhost:3000/sorted for the sorted page.

You can navigate through localhost:3000 to the formpage.

The problem is as follows:
- Problem #1: Project Rating Algorithm 

In this survey, you can see the questions that we ask potential Solar Champions about themselves and the community they wish to put solar on. Could we:
Build this questionnaire onto our website as opposed to having it be on a google form?
Create an algorithm that rates each application based on the qualifications of the volunteer and the viability of the project?
This would likely require many iterations to perfect, but even a basic algorithm to help us weed out the less desirable projects would be beneficial.
